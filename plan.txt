Objective: N number of traders can access the website where they choose their account and wait for the ticks to come and run independent strategies, thus Many User -> Many Strategy relation can be followed.

Key Points: Isolated instance memory -> each user should only be concerned with their data and strategy based parameters. no towo user should be able to modifythe data of each others running strategy parameters

Steps:
1. User goes to localhost:3000, choses account.
2. gets redirected to dashboard, chooses strategy, applies parameters, each parameter must have  its own update button, which would update the strategy parameter corresponding to it
3. after applying strategy it will wait to recieve ticks and process the ticks to work according to the strategy
4. functions pertaining to buy and sell should be created in a util file

logs for each user must be stored in user specific files named based on their user_id (from mongodb)

use react and node if required, make sure the users are isolated and do not share same state or memory.
